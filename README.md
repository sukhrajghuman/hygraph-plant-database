This is a very quick demo using hygraph CMS and next JS to generate a static site to display some plant families and species data. The data is inaccurate and purely for demo purposes.
Sample can be viewed here: plant-database-hygraph.vercel.app.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
