This is a very quick demo using hygraph CMS and next JS to generate a static site to display some plant families and species data. The data is inaccurate and purely for demo purposes.
Sample can be viewed here: plant-database-hygraph.vercel.app

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
